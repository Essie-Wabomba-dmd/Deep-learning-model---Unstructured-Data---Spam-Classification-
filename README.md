####  Deep-learning model withUnstructured Data (Spam Classification)
The aim of this exercise is to build a classification model that can classify the text message either as Ham or Spam i.e Model to predict message type

Keep in mind that the key difference between the unstructure and structured with Keras is the Preprocessing Needed to prepare data.
Text Preprocessing includes but not limited no:
1. Cleaning
2. Stop word removal
3. Lemmatization
4. Numeric representation e.g use TF-IDF vs word embeddings

##### Install the necessary libraries
##### Create text represenations and import data
##### Separate feature and target data
##### Creating a custom tokenizer function to remove stopwords and use lemmatization
#####  Build a TF-IDF Vectorizer model
##### Transform feature input to TF-IDF
##### convert TF-IDF to numpy array
##### Build  a label encoder for target variable to convert strings to numeric values
##### Convert target to one-hot encoding vector
##### Train the model
##### Buiding and Evaluating the Model
- Set Hyper Parameters for building the model
#### Perform Training
- Setup Hyper Parameters for training
### Text Prediction
- Predict for multiple samples using batch processing
- Convert input into IF-IDF vector using the same vectorizer model
- predict using model
- Print prediction classes
